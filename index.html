    - Rape is –“an unlawful sexual activity and usually sexual intercourse carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against a person's will or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent because of mental illness, mental deficiency, intoxication, unconsciousness, or deception”.Merrian Webster.The definition of rape is inconsistent between governmental health organizations, law enforcement,etc.It has varied historically and culturally.
    <br>
    The latest statistics of the rape incident in Bangladesh 2020 does not seem good. Rather, it has been increasing day after day. The incident of murdering women after raping them is the most frightening at present. Though there had been hard and fast law in the country to prevent the rape incident, there has been no stopping. A total of 975 women have been raped between January to September in 2020, according a statistics of Ain O Salish Kendro Bangladesh in 2020. According to the statistics, out of 975, 208 women and children were the victim of gang-rape in Bangladesh. 43 were killed after being raped while 12 committed suicide after rape, the statistics also shows. In the previous year 2019, (January-December) 1,996 cases of violence against children and women were reported. On an average, 10.57 rape cases were filed in a day in five years between 2014 and 2018 as the number of the filing of rape cases was 3,949 in 2018, 3,995 in 2017, 3,728 in 2016, 3,930 in 2015 and 3,695 in 2014.
    <br>
    On October 1, 2020, Ain O Salish Kendra, a Bangladesh-based human rights organization, revealed that from January to September of 2020, men raped more than 1,000 women. Forty-three of those women died, and more than 200 others evaded their rape attempts.Given all these, on October 13, 2020, the government of the country introduced capital punishment against rape in the place of the existing life-term imprisonment.
    During the Liberation War Of Bangladesh in 1971, members of the Pakistani military and Razakar raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women and girls in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape. Most of the rape victims of the Pakistani Army and its allies were Hindu women.

    How can we reduce the risk of becoming a sexual assault victim
    - Anyone can be the target of sexual assault, regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, sexual history, or social class.Nearly 85% of all victims of sexual assault knew the person who raped or assaulted them. Often a situation starts off innocent and fun, but can then very quickly escalate out of control.
    <br>
    To reduce the risk of sexual assault we have to avoid dangerous situation.
    - Sexual assault can occur in any situation and is never your fault regardless of the circumstances. However, by taking such steps as traveling accompanied and avoiding alcohol and drugs, you can significantly reduce your risks for being victimized.

What are human rights?
-Human rights include the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to work and education, and many more.

-Women rights
-Human rights are women rights and women rights are human rights .  We are all intitled to human rights.These include the right to live free from violence and discrimination; to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; to be educated; to own property; to vote; and to earn an equal wage. 


Women right in Education
-Girls have the right same right to education as boys.Women education refers to every form of education that aims at improving the knowledge, and skill of women and girls. It includes general education at schools and colleges, vocational and technical education, professional education, health education, etc.
Women's Rights in Education. Accordingly, it is essential that school environments foster gender equality and provide safe spaces in which all students can learn. Since the enactment of Title IX in 1972, federal law has guaranteed the right to education free from sex discrimination, and since then women and girls have made great strides toward...
Although these happens mostly in rural areas cause their parents in villages do not allow them to have proper education. However, these distinctions are not so evident in urban areas. 


Women Rights in gender equality
Gender equality is when people of all genders have equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities. Everyone is affected by gender inequality - women, men and gender diverse people, children and families. It impacts people of all ages and backgrounds.

Freedom of expression
Freedom of expression refers to the ability of an individual or group of individuals to express their beliefs, thoughts, ideas, and emotions about different issues free from government censorship.
Freedom of expression is a core value in the democratic process. It ensures people are able to discuss, exchange, and debate ideas. This human right allows individuals and communities to find information which is important to them and share it with others, without censorship or reprisals.
Gender equality
The roles of men and women have seen a lot of changes in modern society. The term gender equality means that all people of all genders are able to enjoy the same rights and opportunities in all aspects of their lives. UK laws now mean that men and women should have equal rights in all areas such as pay, the right to vote and the job they do.

      Time to talk about Rape
    </h1>
    <h6>Article by Zunayed Abedin</h6>
    <p class="lead">
      
The global statistics on sexual assault against women are shocking. At least one in every five women experiences rape or attempted rape during her lifetime.1 The recently published report from the United Nations Population Fund on the State of the World Population 2000 is the latest of many official reports that have documented the size of the problem.2 Yet despite clear documentation and the fact that much attention has been paid to the issue of sexual violence against women at international level, the problem is getting worse.

The UN report and other data make it clear that the incidence of rape and other forms of sexual violence is increasing worldwide.3 Yet even official figures underestimate the scale of the problem because the proportion of rapes reported to the authorities varies from 16% in the United States to 3% in South Africa (where even 3% amounted to 49 280 rapes in 1984). The fourth world conference on women in 1995 in Beijing considered violence against women to be one of the 12 critical areas of concern, and a “platform for action” was agreed by the 189 governments present.5 Yet the follow up conference in New York in 2000 agreed that the action had been woefully ineffective,6 and a Human Rights Watch report on six countries—Jordan, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, South Africa, and the United States—concluded that women were actually worse off.4 These six countries are not extreme cases; they reflect the situation for women in most countries.

Perhaps it is not surprising that international action to prevent sexual violence has failed when the judicial system is so often stacked against women who complain of sexual violence. In the United States, for example, some states do not treat sexual misconduct by guards on women prisoners as a criminal offence. In Peru some women have had to deliver police summonses to their abusers, and in Pakistan police often refuse to register a complaint. Forensic examination in some countries focuses solely on whether or not the victim was a virgin. In Jordan officials place women victims in prison, apparently for protective custody, and in most countries the moral standing of the victim is taken into account in the judicial system. One judge in Pakistan allegedly dismissed a case because he felt that the victim had not struggled enough.4

Human Right Watch has identified the high level issues that need to be addressed to counter these problems. They include repealing laws that discriminate against women; eliminating police bias against female victims of sexual assault; ensuring medicolegal systems provide women with appropriate treatment and diagnosis, providing protection from further violence; ensuring that perpetrators are brought to justice; and eliminating judicial bias against women. But some of these measures are hard to implement, because they involve changing attitudes and power relationships, and governments need encouragement to implement them: women need advocates.

The international medical advisory panel of the Planned Parenthood Foundation recommends that healthcare professionals should provide that advocacy, alongside increasing their awareness of sexual violence and their skills in managing victims, providing support and care for the victims, and implementing preventive actions.1 Providing physical care and attention and doing so with sensitivity and understanding obviously fall within the remit of clinicians, but even these are often done badly. Even if the physical consequences of rape—injury, sexually transmitted diseases, and unwanted pregnancy—are dealt with adequately, the psychological consequences are often neglected, with victims rarely being followed up or routinely referred for counselling.7 There are often no standard procedures for dealing with rape victims, and doctors are often ignorant of the sampling techniques and legislative procedures required or where to refer for counselling services even if they do know about the need to investigate and treat sexually transmitted diseases.8,9

Doctors also need to advocate for action as influential members of society. There needs to be a strong, coordinated, bottom up approach to the problem of sexual violence as well as a top down one. Sexual assault is still talked about only in hushed whispers, making it even harder for victims to come to terms with their ordeal and seek the help they need. We need to brush aside the taboos and talk more openly about this huge problem and the practical ways of tackling it. As well as being an individual, every rape victim is also someone's daughter, sister, or mother. It is our responsibility to become involved and take action before these cold statistics become personal.

      Preventing Rape
    </h1>
    <h6>Article by Zubayer Abedin</h6>
    <p class="lead">
      
The only person responsible for committing sexual assault is a perpetrator, but all of us have the ability to look out for each other’s safety. Whether it’s giving someone a safe ride home from a party or directly confronting a person who is engaging in threatening behavior, anyone can help prevent sexual violence.

What is a bystander?
A bystander is a person who is present when an event takes place but isn’t directly involved. Bystanders might be present when sexual assault or abuse occurs—or they could witness the circumstances that lead up to these crimes.

On average there are over 293,000 victims (age 12 or older) of rape and sexual assault each year in the U.S. The majority of these crimes are committed by someone the victim knows. Given these circumstances, it’s important to recognize the role bystanders can play in preventing crimes like sexual assault.

What can I do to prevent sexual assault?
You may have heard the term “bystander intervention” to describe a situation where someone who isn’t directly involved steps in to change the outcome. Stepping in may give the person you’re concerned about a chance to get to a safe place or leave the situation. You don’t have to be a hero or even stand out from the crowd to make a big difference in someone’s life. Take steps to protect someone who may be at risk in a way that fits your comfort level.

Whether you’re taking home a friend who has had too much to drink, explaining that a rape joke isn’t funny, or getting security involved when someone is behaving aggressively, choosing to step in can affect the way those around you think about and respond to sexual violence.

Why don’t people help more often?
It’s not always easy to step in, even if you know it’s the right thing to do. Some common reasons bystanders remain on the sidelines include:

“I don’t know what to do or what to say.”
“I don’t want to cause a scene.”
“It’s not my business.”
“I don’t want my friend to be mad at me.”
“I’m sure someone else will step in.”
It’s okay to have these thoughts, but it’s important to realize that your actions can have a big impact. In many situations, bystanders have the opportunity to prevent crimes like sexual assault from happening in the first place.

Your actions matter
Whether or not you were able to change the outcome of the situation, by stepping in you are helping change the way people think about their roles in preventing sexual violence. If you suspect that someone you know has been sexually assaulted, there are steps you can take to support that person.

So as you guys can see too many people are watching porn. Porn is bad for our sex drive. Pornography permeates many committed relationships and, unfortunately, affects young and old as a pseudo-low libido. What this means is that a person may still be interested in sex, yet not in the correct way. The way they view sexuality deviates, resulting in unrealistic expectations of body image, what an intimate encounter is and, in some cases, can lead to negative sexual behavior. The internet has been an extremely large contributor to this. Often, people who are committed to changing their behavior are referred to sexual addiction counseling to manage this effectively. Is it why I am writing this article? For our sex drive? Wrong. You see I just gave an example of 1 country, US, in the above chart. Imagine about the whole world. In our country Bangladesh, almost from teenagers to adults are porn addicts or were porn addicts. There are many types of porn categories like very much. For example: BDSM were women are treated brutally, Family relations, Father and daughter, Brother and sister, Slavery, servant, etc. Just imagine a person watching all these extreme which a normal person has never experienced, thinking about these to do in real life and fantasizing these all the time. When we watch news about rape, sometimes we see that girls are getting raped in their own houses by their family members or someone working in their homes. Although, their house is the safest place they can be, still they are getting raped there. Sometimes we see in news, a father raped her own daughter. Why? I mean why would a father even think to rape her daughter? Well there are many sides to cover. Since we are on pornography, when a father watches a porn video on father and daughter category he thinks of it. When he watches many videos on this topic, this thing becomes normal to him. Because too many people are doing so. These days, extreme sexual things have become normal because pornography videos are showing them that it's normal to do so. Why is a brother raping her own sister? He sees on videos that other people are doing so and its normal also for him to do so. Why are people raping there own house servants? Because they are watching other people to do so. A few days ago, I heard a news that a 11 year old boy raped a 7 year old girl and he himself confessed that he watched it in porn that’s why. See, we can't blame porn for rape fully. There is lack of education in boys who does rape. There is culture, and many more aspect to cover. Porn changes the mindset of a person who is watching it. It creates a burn in someone to do all the things which are being done on those videos. And I have seen that many people, there own parents and the whole society always judges the girl but not tye rapists. So guys I cant I have made my point clear. Be careful guys. Take care of your sisters and daughters. Bye bye.
